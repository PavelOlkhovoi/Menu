## Automatic menu generation

This project generates random content sections and adds new links to the head menu automatically. The newest active link always takes first place in menu order.  
**Usage:** `numberOfSection(12)` function.

## Menu height control

Head menu should be always not more than 2 rows. All additional links move to the extra hidden menu "Burger". 

## Second Title

The site scrolls to the related section by clicking or scrolling. The active section get class `section-active`
